I went up and back on the JMT as the Mist trail is closed for the winter past the bridge. I enjoyed the hike, but the trail was covered in packed-down snow and refrozen ice, and there were a lot of folks up there who were not prepared for the conditions—I saw a few near tumbles. Actual hiking boots with good tread are not optional, and trekking poles and microspikes are a really good idea. I ended up having to lend my poles to someone in sneakers who wouldn’t have have made it back down uninjured without them, but I was fine because I had my spikes on. It’s a good thing I was there because she still had to descend so carefully we got back to the paved portion of the trail well after last light and only I had a headlamp. Winter hiking can go wrong in a hurry, folks, don’t assume that because Yosemite is a heavily maintained park that all the trails are safe.
