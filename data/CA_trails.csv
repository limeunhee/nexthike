Vernal and Nevada Falls via the Mist Trail,5.0,2870,Yosemite National Park,2191.0,Loop,"Vernal and Nevada Falls via the Mist Trail is a 8.8 mile heavily trafficked loop trail located near Yosemite Valley, California that features a waterfall and is rated as difficult. The trail is primarily used for hiking and is best used from May until October.","Yosemite National Park charges a fee to enter. Fees are $35 per vehicle or $30 per motorcycle. If you are entering on foot, horse, or bike the fee is $20 per person. You can also purchase a park specific annual pass for $70.

Note: As of September 2020, The park has decided to reroute this trail and make a one way loop which starts shortly after the bridge below Vernal Falls and continues on the John Muir Trail after the top of Nevada Falls and back down to the bridge. Additionally, the trail has been reported closed between 7am-4pm during the week. 

During the winter months, portions of the John Muir Trail in Yosemite are closed. Visitors can still visit the falls, but you must return on the stairs, instead of returning on the John Muir Trail.

Hike to two breath-taking waterfalls along Yosemite Valley's most popular hiking trails. If you only have time for one hike while in Yosemite look no further: the Mist Trail is the hike for you.  It is no wonder why this trail is one of the most popular trails in Yosemite Valley. You will hike so close to 2 massive waterfalls that it will be very difficult to avoid the mist from the falls. The best time to hike this trail is in Spring or early Summer, while the snow runoff is high and the falls are full of water.

The Mist Trail starts at Happy Isles trailhead (YARTS shuttle stop #16, and within walking distance of Curry Village and parking lot). After a brief stroll along the river, you climb a pretty steep initial accent until you reach the footbridge, which offers the first glimpse of Vernal Fall in the distance (and a water-fountain and restrooms). You will then continue up to Vernal Fall, past Emerald Pool, and alongside Nevada Fall until you reach the high-point for this hike.

Then take the alternate route down along the John Muir Trail to see views of Nevada Fall and Liberty Cap in the distance before meeting back up with the Mist Trail near the footbridge. The route back is slightly longer, but offers a change of scenery and is easier on the knees. Before hopping back on the YARTS shuttle, treat yourself to some ice cream or a refreshing drink at the small stand, or head over to Curry Village for a larger variety of choices.","['Hiking', 'Forest', 'Partially paved', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'Rocky', 'Snow', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",7461,1521,13298,california,CA,3,260,1,13,8.8,301.0

This trip takes you along the banks of the east fork of the San Gabriel River. While the river banks are wooded and quite lovely, most of the trail traverses the rim above the high water line and most of your travel is through scrub brush. The highlight of the hike is a mysterious bridge built over the east fork in 1936, which has no road leading to it. Actually, in the 1930's a road did lead to it, but was swept away by floods in 1938.

There are some small trails that lead down to the stream just after you cross the bridge. This is a stunning setting with shear pink tinted granite walls, roaring cascades, and the lovely bridge in the background.

Route can be a bit challenging with many day use trails mixed in with the main trail, washed out sections of trail, and over a half dozen stream crossings (bring waterproof boots even when the water is low). There are many swimming holes.

The trail along the East Fork of the San Gabriel River to the Bridge to Nowhere is not only one of the best trails in the San Gabriel Mountains, but it's also one of the most unique hiking experiences you'll ever have.

After you leave the crowded (and overused) trailhead area, you will increasingly find yourself awed by the rugged canyons deep in the Sheep Mountain Wilderness. Multiple river crossings and shaded glens await you on this trek, with the final destination a 130-foot concrete span bridge leftover from an attempt to build a road north through the canyon.

Most of the road is gone now, but the bridge still stands - and is full of bungee jumpers on the weekends. A short trail down from the bridge leads to some top-notch swimming holes, making this a perfect hike on a hot, summer day. Plan on getting your feet wet and bring bug repellent.","['Dogs on leash', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Forest', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Rocky', 'No shade', 'Historic site', 'Fee']",3104,2379,6587,california,CA,2,342,1,11,9.7,233.0

The trail offers great views of the Pacific Ocean - including the Farallon Islands on a clear day - as well as Bass and Pelican lakes.

This is a well-marked coastal trail to Alamere Falls. When you get to the falls walk just past the top fall, cross over it and down to the other falls.

Enjoy the thrilling views of looking down from the top of Yosemite Fall. Yosemite Fall, dropping 2,425 feet to the bottom of the valley from the top, is one of the most visited places in Yosemite National Park. The fall consists of three sections: upper falls, middle cascade and lower falls. While most people visit lower falls only, upper falls is definitely worthy of visiting for its eye-opening views and hiker's self-satisfaction of reaching it.  

The trail to Upper Yosemite Fall is about 4 miles one way, gaining approximately 3,000 feet in elevation along the way. Once you get to the top of the valley, you can go to Yosemite Fall Overlook, a small platform near the mouth of Upper Yosemite Fall, to enjoy the thrilling views of looking down from above. The trailhead is located in the Sunnyside campground (Camp 4) near Yosemite Lodge.

It generally takes 6 - 8 hours for average hikers to complete the roundtrip hike. The trail is generally open for the whole year, but can be difficult to hike in winter due to snow, especially beyond Columbia Rock.

There is also an excellent nature center at Eaton Canyon Park near the trailhead, with great exhibits and many free presentations for those who are interested. This family-friendly Southern California trail will be easy for most, although it gets more rugged the closer you get to the beautiful waterfall. The trail only has a few hundred feet of elevation gain, but there are several stream crossings and areas of boulder-hopping and rock climbing on the way to Eaton Canyon Falls.

Note: As of September 11, 2020, the Southern portion of Yosemite is under a fire advisory and Mariposa Grove is CLOSED. Please see the park's website for up to date information before visiting.

Half Dome is a serious endurance hike taking visitors 4800 feet above the Yosemite Valley to spectacular views of Vernal and Nevada Falls, Liberty Cap, Half Dome, and panoramic views of Yosemite Valley and the High Sierra. A permit is required for this hike, see below.

Preparation and safety are key to having a fantastic experience. This is a hike that requires you to be in shape. Most take 10 to 12 hours to hike to Half Dome and back depending on the routes up and down. Plan to leave around sunrise (or earlier) and then have a non-negotiable turn-around time. The trail is fairly well marked but make sure you watch for all trail signs as you can miss them.

The elevation gain is very strenuous, starting with steep climb in the beginning to Vernal Falls, followed by another steep climb to the top of Nevada Falls. After the second waterfall, there is about 1 mile of fairly level hiking until you reach Little Yosemite Campground, followed by steep switchbacks through the forest. At about 7 miles you will reach a break in the trees, with a beautiful view of the side of Half dome with the valley below. After some steep switchbacks carved like stairs into the rock, you will reach Half Dome with only 400 feet to go. These last 400 feet are the most challenging, but also the most rewarding (although you may not realize it until you are comfortably back on the valley floor).

The famous part of the Half Dome hike is the ascent up the cable route. The two steel cables allow hikers to climb the last 400 feet to the summit without rock climbing equipment. The cables are around a 45-55 degree grade, with wooden supports every 10 to 20 feet to rest and maintain your balance. Using gloves is highly recommended to get a better grip and avoid painful blisters. Be sure to tightly secure your water bottles and cameras for the climb up, because you will want them once at the top. The Half Dome cables usually go up the Friday before Memorial Day (conditions permitting) and come down the day after Columbus Day.

Compared to the hike up, the return journey flies by and before you know it you will be back at the top of Nevada falls. You have 2 options here: the Mist Trail, which is how you came up is about 3.4 miles (5.5km), or the John Muir Trail for a slight change of scenery (about 0.5 miles further). The waterfalls suddenly seem much more pleasant as you hike down compared to earlier uphill climb, and it's hard to hold back a smile as you reach the Vernal Falls bridge where you can refill your water (there are also facilities here). About 30 minutes later you are back at the trail head where you can catch a free shuttle to your car or anywhere else in the valley (there is a concession stand near the bus stop where you can buy cold drinks and ice cream).

Black Star Canyon Trail, a lesser known hiking trail in Orange County of Southern California, is a fun hike to Black Star Canyon Falls. The trail can be accessed off of Highway 241 at Santiago Canyon and after a few miles you will turn left onto Silvarado Canyon and then left onto Black Star Canyon Road. You can park along the road.

Black Star Canyon is an important archaeological site and holds a great deal of history. The canyon was home to the Black Star Coal Mining Company in the 1800s, from which its name is derived. There was also an armed conflict in 1831 between American fur trappers, led by William Woldskill, and a group of native Americans called the Tongva. This was the bloodiest battle in history of the Santa Ana Mountains

The trail starts off on a dirt road and then follows Black Star Creek toward the falls. The last portion of the hike requires boulder hopping up the stream bed to reach Black Star Canyon Falls. This hike is best experienced after heavy rain, as high flow is usually in the rainy season and can be only a trickle during summer and fall. There is heavy poison oak in the area so proceed with caution.

The sea lions have since relocated to the calmer waters of San Francisco Bay. Trails at Lands End offer a cliff-top walk through dark cypress and open grass and 30-mile views up and down the California coast.

The rocky exposed bluffs, often windswept and cloaked in fog, have hampered attempts to tame this corner of San Francisco. Despite the terrain, this section of the Coastal Trail was once a railroad bed, and the adjacent street, El Camino del Mark, once extended through Lands End. The two roads led to the Cliff House, Sutro Baths, and Ocean Beach.

The upper one is interesting because you have to climb up the waterfall via a 10 ft. high ladder. These waterfalls are best seen in the winter or early spring months, after there has been a lot of rain. Once at Pantoll, cross the highway and head back down to Stinson Beach via the Matt Davis trail. You will find more great ocean views on this trail. Many people like to do this hike in the reverse direction, going up Matt Davis trail and down Steep Ravine. But the Matt Davis trail is longer (4 miles) and it is all up hill if you go this way.","['Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Beach', 'Forest', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Muddy', 'No dogs']",5050,1332,5814,california,CA,2,287,1,12,6.7,221.0

The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from March until November. Dogs are also able to use this trail.","A strenuous loop to the 10,068' summit of Baldy.  Any Southern Californian can point out the white topped Mt. Baldy - actually it's real name is Mt. San Antonio. Baldy is a SoCal icon that stands out boldly as a snow-covered backdrop for much of the year. At 10,068 feet above sea level, the snow often sticks around well into June.

This loop begins at the Manker Flats trailhead (National Parks Adventure Pass required), taking the winding fire road up Baldy Notch, then hiking the Devil's Backbone to the summit. The return route takes you down via the steep Baldy Bowl trail, passing the Sierra Club Ski Hut and San Antonio Falls on the way back to Manker Flats.

This is the third of six southern California summits in the 6-Pack of Peaks bundle. Done in sequence, they provide great training anyone preparing for bigger hikes such as Mt. Whitney or Half Dome. Each hike in the 6-Pack is progressively higher in altitude, and all have respectable distance and vertical elevation gain.

When you're at Baldy Notch, there are several paths that head towards Mt. Baldy (none of the marked).  DO NOT take the far left path.  That will take you to the foot of the Turkeyshoot ski run.  It may be the most direct, but your legs will never forgive you for going up that run. 

No matter how you get there, though, all of the trails take you to Devil's Backbone, which leads you to Baldy.  It's not so bad before the final ascent, but there are places where both sides of the trail drop away, and you could get some vertigo, if you're prone to it.  But the ascent is the real butt-kicker.  When you round Mt. Harwood and head for Baldy, the rest of your path is brutal and relentless. 

The views at the top are incredible, and there's wind-breaks other folks have constructed out of stones, so you can take a breather behind one of those if it's too gusty.  From there, you have your pick of ways down, either back the way you came, down the Baldy Bowl/Ski Hut trail, or the Bear Canyon trail.  Good luck. 

Make sure to check when the ski lift closes, if you plan to take it back.

NOTE: Be sure to park outside of the white line along the road. It can be difficult to see in the snow but the police will have you towed if parked incorrectly.","['Dog friendly', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Snowshoeing', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Forest', 'Partially paved', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'Scramble', 'Snow', 'Historic site']",6533,1128,5370,california,CA,3,339,1,17,11.5,342.0

The first 3 miles to Lower Pierce Point Ranch are well marked and maintained, but the last stretch can be overgrown with bush lupine and other shrubs, so long pants and long sleeves are a good idea. The journey all the way to the Point is worth it, for the view is unparalleled. Fog and wind can limit visibility and make this hike more challenging.

Only the first mile is easily accessible as there is very steep exposed terrain after the falls.

The Horsetail falls hike is a short hike with great views that gets you up close with this spectacular South Lake Tahoe waterfall.

The hike starts at Twin Bridges Trailhead off of Highway 50 just past Strawberry. There is a $5.00 fee to park in the parking area at Twin Bridges. From the trailhead, you will follow Pyramid Creek Trail into Desolation Wilderness so a wilderness permit from the ranger station is required.

The hike starts out moderate but quickly picks up elevation as you enter Desolation Wilderness and the Wilderness Boundary Trail. The last half mile of the hike can be difficult, as there is granite rock and boulders that require rock climbing and the trail is not well marked and hard to follow. Once you reach the first rapids/falls area there is a sign. The trail picks back up directly to the left of the sign. If in doubt after this point, stay closer to the water. Once at the falls, you have the option to continue on, however proceed with caution as there are slippery rocks

Late spring and early summer may be the best times to experience Horsetail Falls, as the water flow is heaviest. However a hike up the Pyramid Creek trail to this spectacular waterfall is still a worthwhile experience at any time of the year.

The best place to enjoy the view of Half Dome from the top.

Cloud's Rest, a massive granite formation just northeast of Half Dome in Yosemite Valley, is famous for its very high degree of visual prominence in the valley as well as its razor-sharp ridge near the summit. For people who have hiked Cloud's Rest, they are most impressed with the thrilling feeling they have while scrambling up the narrow ridge, with sheer drop-offs on both sides, to the summit. The fastest way to day hike Cloud's Rest starts from the Sunrise Lakes trailhead on Tioga Road near Tenaya Lake.

From the trailhead, you start the hike by following the trail markers for Sunrise H.S.C. After the first 1.5 mile hike on the relatively flat trail, you begin to climb up the lower slope below Sunrise Mountain. The switchbacks on the slope will surely pound your heart as you are gaining 1,000 feet in elevation in just one mile before reaching the top of the slope. 

On the top, you immediately encounter the Y junction for either Cloud's Rest or Sunrise Lakes.  Bear right for Cloud's Rest and begin to follow the trail markers for it from now on. The trail beyond the junction (called Forsyth Trail) descends sharply for 0.5 miles until you reach the flat land below Sunrise Mountain. The trail on the land is about 1.7 miles long and traverses beautiful woods and a nice lake before you encounter the next junction. 

Bear right at the T junction for Cloud's Rest and you are about 1.5 miles away from it (though the marker says 2.5 miles). Since you're approaching Cloud's Rest from its back, you only begin to see it after passing the junction. Keep hiking up on the trail until you encounter the marker for Cloud's Rest Foot Trail. Use extreme caution beyond this point as the passway on the top of Cloud's Rest is narrow and both sides are sheer drip-offs. You can enjoy the spectacular views of Half Dome, Tenaya Canyon and surrounding mountains after a short scramble to the summit where you can find a geology mark on it. Take the same way back to the Sunrise Lakes trailhead once you're ready to return.","['Backpacking', 'Camping', 'Hiking', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'Rocky', 'Scramble', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",1728,1084,2414,california,CA,3,297,1,13,13.0,423.0

The Four Mile Trail switchbacks 3200 feet down from Glacier Point to Yosemite Valley, providing wonderful views of the valley.  See Half Dome, North Dome, El Capitan, Cathedral Rocks, the Royal Arches, and full views of Yosemite Falls.  From the top, the trail is fairly flat for the first mile, then hits relentless switchbacks at the reverse Tunnel View and then along cliffside views to Union Point at the 1.8 mile mark, that then take you into the trees and down to the valley floor near the Swinging Bridge. 

Views are more spectacular closer to the top of the trail such that if you don't want to go the whole trail in both directions and have transportation (bus or private car) to or from the top, you can hike a partial way down from the top to the switchbacks and the reverse Tunnel View, taking in the best views.

The end of the trail puts you at the visitor center at Glacier point. The trip down, while not as strenuous as the trip up, requires your attention due to the decomposed granite. The trail can be very slippery.

[Note/Winter Road Closures: The Glacier Point Road closes due to snow, usually from sometime in November through late May or early June.

A quick stroll to see Yosemite Falls, the tallest waterfall in Northern America and 5th in the world crash down on the rocks below. 

Open year-round, this trail is easy but icy in the winter. This is a 1 mile/1.6 km loop which takes about 30 minutes to complete. The trailhead is at the Lower Yosemite Fall Trailhead (shuttle stop #6). This short, easy walk provides spectacular views of Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls and even Middle Cascade. 

Like all waterfalls in Yosemite, this waterfall is often dry from late July or August through October and is best seen in spring when the winter snow is melting and the upper lakes are full, significantly increasing the flow of the water over the edge.

Accessibility: This trail is paved, typically at least four feet wide, and mostly flat except for steeper grades near the viewing area at the end of the route (grade starts to increase at about 0.7 miles). The last 180 feet has a slope of 14% so only the first half of this trail is considered wheelchair/mobility equipment and stroller friendly. There is a free accessible shuttle available at shuttle stop #6 as well as accessible bathrooms at the trailhead.

Moro Rock Trail in Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Park scales a granite dome via a steep 1/4-mile staircase to the summit offering a spectacular view of the Great Western Divide and the western half of the park.

The parking area for Moro Rock is 2 miles from the village. A steep 1/4 mile staircase climbs over 300' to the summit of a granite dome, offering spectacular views of the western half of Sequoia National Park and the Great Western Divide. This chain of mountains runs north/south through the center of Sequoia National Park, ""dividing"" the watersheds of the Kaweah River to the west and the Kern River to the east. 

Moro Rock is a dome-shaped granite monolith. Common in the Sierra Nevada, these domes form by exfoliation - casting off in scales, plates, or sheets of rock layers on otherwise unjointed granite. Outward expansion of the granite causes the exfoliation. Expansion results from load relief: when the overburden that once capped the granite has eroded away, the source of compression is removed, and the granite slowly expands. Fractures that form during exfoliation tend to cut corners. This ultimately results in rounded, dome-like forms.","['Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Rock climbing', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",890,644,3445,california,CA,2,250,1,13,0.4,17.0

Tackle the highest peak in Lassen Volcanic National Park and stand atop an active volcano.

Located four hours north east of San Francisco this Northern California park might be a little out of the way, but it's a prime destination for seekers of tranquility and those with even just a passing interest in geology.

Mount Lassen is a towering testament to the volcanic origins of this region, and an imposing sight from the trailhead on the shores of Lake Helen. 

Starting at the parking lot in Lassen National Park, this popular trail makes a steep climb to the summit of Lassen Peak.  The hike can be difficult, but the views are well worth the effort.  It is truly a worth-while adventure to the top of an active volcano.

On the main road through Lassen National Park, a parking lot at the trailhead marks the beginning of the journey.  The trail starts at 8500 feet in elevation, and ascend quickly.  The high altitude in combination with the steep ascent can make this hike difficult, but the trail is relatively short, a mere 2.5 miles in each direction.  There no trees to shade the hike, so be prepared for direct sunlight the entire trip.  The trail remains a popular destination, because of its spectacular views, and the bragging rights of climbing this active volcano.","['Camping', 'Cross country skiing', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Rock climbing', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'River', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'Snow', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",1859,1117,2517,california,CA,3,238,1,17,5.1,203.0

Sea lions, shore birds and more share this gorgeous chunk of Pacific Coast south of Carmel, California

You can cram all the charms of California's amazing coastline into one stop at Point Lobos State Reserve, about 100 miles south of San Francisco. 

It's all there at Point Lobos: crashing waves, barking sea lions, chattering shorebirds, sun-bathing sea otters, remarkable rock formations. Granted, you get a few nibbles of this anywhere along California Highway 1, but why not save your appetite for the whole feast?

Point Lobos has a network of well-maintained trails, but it's not really a hiking destination. Better to just find a place to park, find a trail, walk toward the sound of the ocean and enjoy the scenery.

Best time to go: September, when the summer heat is easing and the coast is less foggy. The rest of the year will do, however. Park authorities limit the number of cars allowed in Point Lobos, so you might have to leave the car outside the park on Highway 1 and walk in.

Lake Clementine Trail leads to the spot where the North Fork Dam meets the rocks for an outstanding view of cascading water. Trail passes under the tallest bridge in California, Foresthill Bridge. The waterfall is absolutely amazing.  There are rarely any people at the base of the falls but there is an abundance of poison oak so you need to be careful. 

Another good feature about this hike is about a quarter of a mile into the hike you pass by Clark's Pool - a fairly popular swimming hole.  Despite being in the middle of the river, it is actually quite warm and very refreshing - especially since the first half of the hike is totally unshaded and gets rather hot.

Sentinel Dome starts from Glacier Point Road and scales one of Yosemite's high domes and offers a full breathtaking 360 degree view.

It provides one of the very best NP experiences for the effort you can find. To the west, you'll see almost a reverse Tunnel View of the Yosemite Valley and can see beyond to the Merced River canyon. To the north is Yosemite Valley, including El Capitan and Yosemite Falls. You'll see Nevada Falls, Half Dome and Clouds Rest to the east, and many of the High Sierra peaks.

This summit was made famous by Ansel Adam's 1940 photo of the Jeffrey Pine tree. The tree perished in 1977, and fell over in 2003.  The trail crosses a bridge over a stream near the beginning of the hike and gradually slopes up along a granite floor among the pines.  It then turns slightly left and after a gradual climb through more pines, meets the base of the dome, where you then take a sharp left straight up onto the exposed dome.  Enjoy the views!

An alternate route begins at the service road entrance about a half mile towards Glacier Point from the main trailhead.

1. You'll start out at the Parking lot which is .5 miles from the pit toilets and trail head. Elevation gain is 246 feet to get your legs limbered up.
2. From there you have the option to follow the road or to take the trail. If you take the road to the trail junction it's .4 mile with an elevation gain of 268 feet.
3. If you take the trail to the junction with the road it's .5 mile with an elevation gain of 257 feet. Plenty of switch-backs with some nice views. Take the trail. 
4. From trail road junction, over the next 1.4 miles, the trail/road ascends and descends with a couple of steep spots. Enjoy the views and relative ease of the hiking, this is probably the easiest part of the trail. 
5. At 2.2 miles from the parking area, the trail will start a steep descent into a drainage for the surrounding peaks and will take a sharp southeasterly turn. Because the water that falls on the surrounding hills is focused into this drainage the vegetation becomes much more lush with trees and other vegetation not seen on other parts of the trail.
6. Around 2.8 miles from the parking lot, the road will begin a very steep ascent as it swings back to the east and then northeast. This is the first of the worst part of this hike. The trail gets more rugged and rutted at this point and if you aren't wearing hiking shoes or boots you may begin to wish you were.
7. As you continue to ascend you will notice another trail/road that veers off to the left. Going back to paragraph 5, if you look left and up-slope you can see this trail slashing across the mountain. You can continue on the trail ahead or take this alternate route. If you go left it is slightly shorter but considerably steeper. I've gone both ways, and staying to the right is probably the better way. As you ascend, the views become more and more spectacular. On a good day you can see all the way to the ocean.
8. As you continue you will come to a stop sign with a notice that tells you it will take 1.5 hours to return to the parking lot from this point and that if it's past 12:30 pm you should not attempt to reach the El Cajon mountain summit. In winter, they close and lock the gates to the parking lot at 4:30 pm, so if you are parked in the lot, plan accordingly. The point here is know your limitations! 
9. From the stop sign, over the next .6 mile, you will climb 467 feet to a saddle between a large peak on your left and a smaller one on your right. From there you will drop 290 feet over the next half mile or so, until you start the climb to the next saddle. This section of the trail is steep, rutted and in some places partly washed out and it doesn't improve much the rest of the way. You may find yourself wondering if you've gone astray, because the trail seems to be going north away from where you want to be. But stay steady, the trail is taking you around, rather than over the peak to your right at the saddle.  
10. As you continue, you will find yourself climbing again to another saddle where you will come to a three way junction. Over that .8 mile stretch, you will gain 642 feet, so if you thought the other side of the mountain was tough, this is tougher. But congratulations, you're almost there. Stop and check out the old jeep hulk as you go.
11. The saddle is a good place to take a break, load some calories and steel your nerves for the final push. When you are ready, you'll take the trail to your left (due east). At this point, you will begin bushwhacking, there are only a couple of trail markers to be seen, but if you pay attention, the trail isn't that hard to follow. Over the next .6 miles to the summit, you'll gain another 424 feet. Once at the summit you'll find that the view and sense of accomplishment make the hike worthwhile.
Don't try this hike unless you are in relatively good shape. As many people have already said, bring plenty of water, food and good footwear.","['Dog friendly', 'Hiking', 'Mountain biking', 'River', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'Rocky', 'Scramble', 'Washed out', 'No shade']",1703,1120,2932,california,CA,3,286,1,12,11.3,418.0

The trail meets up with the Bay Area Ridge Trail, and turns back up the ridge. This trail heads through some more redwood groves, and the ocean views return when the trail meets up with Harkins Ridge Trail.

This is a slightly longer version of the popular Purisima Redwood Preserve area hike and starts on the eastern trailhead on the coastal side.  The trail begins at the point where 3 of the major tributaries of the Purisima Creek joins into one and continues its flow into the Pacific ocean.

A major part of the hike is in the shades of redwoods. However, towards the latter part with elevation gain the trail opens out to give some good views of the ocean.

This excursion is of gentle switchbacks through canopies of black oaks, sycamores, and other coniferous trees.

Short nature trail building to a crescendo at the foot of one of California's most spectacular waterfalls. Without question Burney Falls is one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the state. The 129ft waterfall thrills visitors to McArthur Burney Falls Memorial State Park all year round, even when the California summer has dried up every other waterfall around.

Located in the Cascade mountains, forty miles north of Lassen Volcanic National Park the falls are given their longevity by the release of meltwater from porous volcanic rock from the surrounding mountains. 

Two large streams cascade from the top of the falls and are accompanied by curtains of water fed from underground streams, creating a unique and grand appearance to the waterfall.

The one mile journey loops around the falls in a clockwise direction, beginning with an overlook from above the waterfall and descending into the valley towards the foot of the attraction. With the falls hidden from view for much of the trail, visitors can focus on the interpretive signs on the nature trail and enjoy the shade that the park's greenery provides.

The crescendo of the trail reaches its peak at the bottom of Burney Falls where you can experience the force nature from up close. The return journey is along a short set of switchbacks which afford even more views of the falls.

Fern Canyon is a surrealistic and amazing display of primal ferns growing in a narrow 50-foot-deep vertical walled canyon. The floor is nearly all creek bed which helps provide a contrast of water, gravel, stumps and downed trunks.

Fern Canyon was used for several scenes in the movie Jurassic Park 2: Lost Worlds (1997) and the BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs (2000) for very good reason.

Expect slow going in the canyon.  At least 5 species of fern and dozens of other plant species create an overload of color, shape, and texture. 

Add to the sensory mix a combination of light climbing over logs, ankle deep creek crossings, little animal surprises (amphibians and in one spot, millions of centipedes), a total lack of modern sounds (if it's not a busy day), birds, insect noises, the breeze through the trees...overall, it is an amazing experience.

Drive or hike in. Hiking will make a day trip of it or if you prefer to spend the weekend, there are a number of camping options,  

Driving in to the park is a small adventure in itself. The road in is largely unpaved but is suitable for 2 w/d cars. These old dirt roads provide a far better visceral experience than paved streets in these forests. But be careful - the road can be narrow and has plenty of blind curves.

The final leg of the road traces the coast between the narrow coastal plains and bluffs. It provides access to beach camping and several additional trail heads. Expect 2 or 3 shallow creek crossings on the way in to the canyon.

The park is designated as a World Heritage Site and International Biosphere Reserve.

The park's tree cover primarily consists of old-growth coast redwood, hemlock and Douglas fir. Sitka spruce and Red Alder provide additional forest cover. 

Because of frequent coastal fogs, the forest understory vegetation can get very lush and dense. Tan oaks, cascara, maples and California bay can be found on edges and grassland spaces. Western azalea and rhododendron bloom in May and June and offer bright accents and pops of color to the dense green of the forest.","['Kid friendly', 'Camping', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Forest', 'Waterfall', 'Wildlife', 'Muddy', 'Scramble', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",893,596,2083,california,CA,1,233,1,13,1.1,31.0

This loop from the eastern entrance of the Pinnacles provides the most direct route to the High Peaks, where a series of ladders and multiple tight squeezes take hikers through a geological maze that has made the Pinnacles a favorite among  hikers from throughout California. 

While the rocks and expansive vistas are the main attractions, you might get lucky and spot some of the rare California condors that nest in the park and soar high above. 

Trails on this hike: 

Condor Gulch Trail; High Peaks Trail; Bear Gulch Trail. 

Starting from the Bear Gulch parking area, you can go either way. Condor Gulch Trail is a bit steeper, so you may want to start out there to get your climbing done on fresh legs and spare your knees on the way down. 

Best time to go: Springtime adds wildflowers to the awesome scenery, making it a near perfect hike. Summer will be too hot and autumn may be too dry, but winter should be gorgeous if you give the trails a couple days to dry out after passing storm systems.

This is one of the finest hikes in the San Gabriel Mountains. You climb the heart of scenic Icehouse Canyon into the Cucamonga Wilderness to Icehouse Saddle, then to the top of the 8303-foot Timber Mountain.

From the trailhead follow the path east, under a canopy of oak, alder, spruce, cedar, fir, and pine. After 1.8 miles you reach the entrance to the Cucamonga Wilderness. The trail gets steeper as you travel up the canyon. In 3.5 miles from the start, you reach Icehouse Saddle, a nice destination if you'd like to turn back at this point. If you're heading on to Timber Mountain, take the trail to the left (north). Follow the trail as it switchbacks up the southwest-facing slope of Timber. At the west ridge before the trail heads down to the saddle between Timber Mountain and Telegraph Peak, turn right (east) on the marked spur trail, following it .25 mile to the summit. After soaking in the beauty of this splendid high country, return the way you came.

Malibu Creek State Park is a sprawling 10,000 acre park that protects 25-mile long Malibu Creek, the largest watershed in the Santa Monica Mountains.  The creek itself is somewhat unusual in that it has cut a path through hard volcanic rock instead of the softer sedimentary rocks north of the Goat Buttes, which makes for some spectacular scenery during any time of the year.

More than 30 miles of trails and fire roads are available throughout the park for hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians.  There are also a few areas to swim and fish, and many rock climbers also practice their craft here.

The area used to be a country club, and some of the buildings and landscaping from that era remains to this day - including the Visitor Center and Century Lake - originally built as a recreational lake and now a unique freshwater marsh that provides a stop-over for migratory birds in the winter.

The park has also been home to filmmakers over the years.  Movies like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" ""The Planet of the Apes,"" and the television show ""M*A*S*H"" were all shot here - and several setpieces from M*A*S*H are still here.

This route follows the namesake of the park as it meanders through several areas of spectacular scenery.

The Mishe Mokwa Trail is a beautiful, well-maintained trail that takes you through a variety of landscapes and showcases the scenic views of the Santa Monica Mountains.  When combined with Tri-Peaks and Sandstone Peaks, the view is improved considerably.

This trail takes you from Yerba Buena Road (via Backbone Trail from the second parking lot) to the Mishe Mowka Trailhead and climbs north-west to the shaded Split Rock.  Along the way, you'll pass Balanced Rock (on your right).  From here, you head west to the (unmaintained) spur to Tri-Peaks.  

It's 0.5 miles to the summit of Tri-Peaks (3010'), and it's a lot steeper and more rugged than you've come across so far, but it also opens up to arguably the best view on this hike.  There's also plenty of rocks to scramble around on, and if you're lucky, a nice breeze to enjoy.  When you're done, head back down to the main trail, and make sure to follow the trail markers pointing you towards Sandstone Peak.  It's not hard to get turned around here as the trail loops to the east, so if you're headed in the right direction, you should be passing two water tanks to your right.

This portion of Backbone Trail continues to climb as you pass Inspiration Point, Boney Peak (in the distance), and then arrive at Sandstone Peak.  The climb to the summit (3111') is fairly intense at this point in the hike (5.5 miles in, if you scrambled up to Tri Peaks and back), and it can be a little crowded depending on when you make it here.  But you'll be able to read the crazy things people write in the registry, and add your own commentary when you get to the top.  When you're done taking in the sights from the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains, scramble back down and make sure you take your immediate right to continue east towards to the trail head.  

From Sandstone Peak, the trail will begin a steady and sometimes sharp decline, as you lose close to 1000' of the elevation you gained getting here in 1.5 miles.  If you parked in the second lot, make sure to pass the first marker (signifying the Sandstone Peak Trailhead), and return to the Mishe Mokwa Trailhead, before turning right and heading back to Yerba Buena Road.","['Dogs on leash', 'Camping', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Rock climbing', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'Over grown', 'No shade']",3867,529,1890,california,CA,2,322,1,14,6.8,233.0

Another bonus: touring the grounds of a farm replete with antique cars, farm machinery and other remnants of farming life along the Pacific in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Wilder family ran a dairy farm on this land from the 1880s to the 1970s.

Will's Ranch became his refuge where he relaxed with family and friends while pursuing his favorite pastimes of riding and roping.

In 1944 Betty Rogers deeded the Ranch to California State Parks as a living memorial to Will and his tireless efforts in healing the hearts of a broken nation and eliminating suffering.

This is an out-and-back hike and unlike other hikes, both directions are amazing, revealing a constant supply of sights you may have missed on the way in. It's really a toss-up over which direction is better.

The trip to the trail head is an adventure as you walk through a magnificent old-growth grove on Howland Hill Road. Much of the route is on an old dirt logging road that's kept well graded. If you've never toured on logging roads, you should absolutely do it! There's a visceral something totally lacking on paved roads. This one's easily passable in 2WD. 

At the trailhead, located in a spectacular redwood grove, there's a little pullout that can accommodate about six cars.","['Kid friendly', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Forest', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'No dogs']",705,453,1200,california,CA,2,267,1,13,6.3,151.0

It starts on the San Andreas Trail and takes a vigorous march up the hillside west of the park. The trail can be steep in places, but you'll be covered in a canopy of redwoods that'll shade you from the sun and help you forget why you need to be away from civilization for a few hours.

Hike this lesser-known trail to discover Chilnualna Falls with a wading pool and cascades waiting at the top.

Chilnuala Falls is a well-kept secret in Yosemite, simply because the majority of visitors to Yosemite National Park don't venture out of the Valley.  If you are staying in Wawona, or have entered Yosemite through the South Entrance, then Chilnualna Falls is on your way down to the valley.

Like most waterfall hikes in Yosemite (Lower Yosemite Falls and Bridalveil Fall excluded) you start below the waterfall and must hike up it, which means significant elevation gain.

The trail starts around 4,000ft and you will hike up 2,200 feet to 6,200ft by the time you reach the top of the falls.

The Falls are separated into 2 distinct sections: the shorter section is on top, and consists of several smaller waterfalls, leading into a pool before falling another 240ft final drop, a total of about 690ft.

Unfortunately, you never get a clear view of the entire falls, and it is hard to even see the longer fall in its entirety except from the top (and you won't want to get too close to the edge).  Luckily the pool and falls at the top are more than worth the steep 4-mile climb up.","['Hiking', 'Forest', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",688,317,824,california,CA,2,248,1,9,7.9,280.0

Tilden’s 2,079 acres feature the iconic carousel, steam train, botanical gardens, Little Farm, Environmental Education Center, redwood groves, picturesque views of the bay, picnic areas, and seasonal swimming at Lake Anza.

Trails Highlights: Please note: portions of this trail are severely storm-damaged and may be difficult to navigate when wet and muddy. Check District website for possible closures before proceeding. This trail starts at placid Lake Anza and descends along the Wildcat Creek drainage through tall redwoods and shady oak/ bay woodlands. It then gently climbs Meadows Canyon through grassland and scrub, eventually dropping back down to the creek.

Trail Directions: Park at Lake Anza Parking lot; if closed, use the gravel overflow lot outside the gate. Proceed to the Lake Anza entrance near the bathhouse and swim area. Outside the bathhouse area, turn left and follow the paved Lake Anza Trail a few hundred yards. At the Spillway, cross the bridge to your right and then turn left onto the Wildcat Gorge Trail to descend to the creek. At the bottom of the dam, you’ll see a small stone building which was the old pump house for the lake. Continue down Wildcat Gorge Trail past the Curran turnoff for approximately 0.75 mile. At the bottom of the canyon, turn right onto Meadows Canyon Trail, near the Lone Oak Picnic area. Due to storm damage, the creek crossing
may be difficult.

A mostly-downhill hike with views of Half Dome, Nevada Fall, Vernal Fall, Yosemite Falls and the Yosemite Valley.

There is no better hike in Yosemite National Park which offers the amazing views of Half Dome, Vernal Fall, Nevada Fall, Illilouette Fall, Yosemite Fall, and the entire Valley than the Panorama Trail.  This hike will take you on an adventure from Glacier Point, high above the valley, down to the Mist Trail where you will hike next to both Nevada and Vernal Falls.  The hike ends near Curry Village where you can grab a bite to eat or take the free shuttle to anywhere in the park.

While this hike loses 2,800ft in elevation, it is not an easy hike; some would even rate it as strenuous.  After the initial climb down to Illilouette Fall you will hike back up 800ft of steep switchbacks before hiking down the same distance immediately after.  The Mist Trail can be especially tough on the knees, especially the section from the top of Nevada Fall to Vernal Fall, which is almost exclusively made up of small stone steps.

But don't let that discourage you, the views of the Falls, the Valley, and the surrounding area more than make up for the aches and pains you may keep with you the next few days.","['Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Bird watching', 'Forest', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",7325,94,1404,california,CA,3,306,1,11,10.0,257.0

In 1903, the Union Rock Company founded a quarry, originally named Brush Canyon, for excavation of crushed rock used in the construction of city streets. The quarry ceased operation in the late 1920s, leaving the caves behind. The caves became known as the Bronson Caves after a nearby street, giving the area its more popular name of Bronson Canyon (the same street indirectly provided the stage name for actor Charles Bronson, who chose the name of the Bronson Gate at Hollywood's Paramount Studios, which in turn derived its name from Bronson Street).

The hike itself is really more of a walk up to the caves/tunnels; however, three blazed trails abound from the cavern site. None are marked, but they are easily recognizable from the cavern site:

1. Connect into the Brush Canyon trail (heading North) following a parallel path with Canyon Drive (NOTE: Steep and dangerous grade)
2. Connect to Hollywood and/or Western Canyon roads via a 1 1/4 mile route called the Griffitite Serpentine (NOTE: Steep and dangerous grade)

Today, Claremont Canyon provides the community with breathtaking panoramic views of the Bay Area and the opportunity for a vigorous workout.

Trail Highlights: Though this trail has an elevation gain of 945 feet with four very steep segments, there are several terraced spots that provide great opportunities to relax and enjoy the view. Along your hike you will see a variety of vegetation including oak, bay laurel, and eucalyptus trees, California sagebrush, and many other plant communities. Claremont Canyon is also home to a variety of animal species including the black-tailed deer, coyote, gray fox, red-tailed hawk, and the western garter snake.

Trail Directions: Begin at the trailhead on Stonewall Road. Enter the park and stay to the right to begin Stonewall Panoramic Trail. The trail will make a sharp right and gradually get steeper. Be aware of many unmarked trails that diverge from the Stonewall Panoramic Trail. Once you reach the top, turn around and retrace your steps back to the trailhead.

The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from May until November.","Calaveras Big Trees State Park preserves two groves of giant sequoia trees. It is located 4 miles (6.4 km) northeast of Arnold, California in the middle elevations of the Sierra Nevada. It has been a major tourist attraction since 1852, when the existence of the trees was first widely reported, and is considered the longest continuously operated tourist facility in California. The area was declared a state park in 1931 and now encompasses 6,498 acres (2,630 ha) in Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties.

Over the years other parcels of mixed conifer forests, including the much larger South Calaveras Grove of Giant Sequoias (purchased in 1954 for $2.8 million USD), have been added to the park to bring the total area to about 26 square kilometres (6,400 acres). The North Grove contains about 100 mature giant sequoias; the South Grove, about 1,000.

The North Grove included the 'Discovery Tree' noted by Augustus T. Dowd in 1852 and felled in 1853, leaving a giant stump which is the only remainder of the tree. It measured 24 feet (7.3 m) in diameter at its base and was determined by ring count to be 1,244 years old when felled. However, the largest tree was believed to be the Mother of the Forest, which died after bark was stripped from it in 1854. Today only a fire-blackened snag remains.

In addition to the popular North Grove, the park also now includes the South Grove, with a 5-mile (8.0 km) hiking trip through a grove of giant sequoias in their natural setting. The South Grove includes the Louis Agassiz tree, 250 feet (76 m) tall and 25 feet (7.6 m) in diameter 6 feet (1.8 m) above ground, the largest tree in the Calaveras groves.[2] It is named after zoologist Louis Agassiz (18071873).

Other attractions in the Park include the Stanislaus River, Beaver Creek, the Lava Bluff Trail and Bradley Trail.

The park also houses two main campgrounds with a total of 129 campsites, six picnic areas and hundreds of miles of established trails.

Even at maximum flow, the waterfall is so-so. The hike, however, is excellent. Two beastly climbs top out on ridges overlooking some of the wildest country in this part of California.

Each paragraph below roughly corresponds to a day on the trail, although there are many ways to break up the hike, and day hikes are also possible.

1. The HST begins at Crescent Meadow, or start from the trailhead at Wolverton. The trail climbs along a steep ridge. To the right, the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River. To your left, the summit of Alta Peak at 11,000 feet. The 1st camp is at 9-Mile Creek - this creek is not labeled as such, but is referred to as 9-Mile because it is 9 miles in. Or, move on to the next creek crossing (Buck) or to the backpacker camp at Bearpaw Meadow. All three have bear boxes.

2. The second stretch is exposed alpine terrain. From Buck, the trail climbs 600 ft to Bearpaw Meadow. Here is a backpacker's camp. For the next two miles, the trail descends from Bearpaw to Lone Pine Creek. You will find a bridge over a gorge but it's another mile until easy water. There are some campsites throughout. Here you find granite formations like Valhalla and Angel Wings. Eventually you reach Hamilton Lake. Stay here or continue up to Precipice and through Hamilton Gorge. This stretch ends at Precipice Lake.

3. Hike along through a boulder field and past some shallow ponds in an alpine zone.  A mile in you'll be standing atop Kaweah Gap, the pass which marks the trail's crossing of the Great Western Divide. 9-Lakes basin is to your left, but to stay on the trail descend to your right into Big Arroyo. The trail descends through Big Arroyo for several miles, eventually meeting a trail junction near an old patrol cabin. There are many campsites scattered. This junction is the beginning of a gradual, hot climb out of Big Arroyo. It is the driest stretch of the trail so fill up on water in the Arroyo. As you climb you'll get views of the southern peaks of the Great Western Divide before entering the forest atop Chagoopa Plateau. Eventually, if you choose the right fork at the trail junction, you'll arrive at Moraine Lake, a great place for a swim and camp.

4. For the first few miles of this stretch you'll get to enjoy easy hiking as the trail winds gradually through the woods with no steep ascents or descents. If you have a sharp eye, keep a lookout for Mount Whitney in the distance. It's not a clear view, but it's the first peek you'll get of the highest point in the lower 48 states, one you'll hopefully be standing on in a few short days. You'll pass the remains of an old sheep herder's cabin and through a forest of burnt tree trunks. Eventually you'll hike along the southeastern edge of Sky Parlor Meadow with an unobstructed view of Mt Kaweah. After joining back together with the other fork of the High Sierra Trail, the long, ~2500 foot descent into the Kern Canyon begins. It starts off moderate but turns into tight, rocky, steep switchbacks. Before the switchbacks, the trail passes through a dense field of ferns - this is where you need to go on rattlesnake alert. They are common here and on the upcoming stretch of trail.

5. Next is a simple and easy stretch at the midpoint of the High Sierra Trail. The trail parallels the Kern River, climbing gradually through the Canyon. You'll have plenty of water access. Approximately eight miles from the Hot Spring you'll reach Junction Meadow, the not-so-cleverly named open space where other the High Sierra Trail meets the trail to Colby Pass and other destinations to the west. There are many campsites at Junction Meadow. From here, the trail follows the right fork of the Kern River and starts to climb. Before too long you'll reach the junction to Wallace Creek. The High Sierra Trail continues to the right with a sign informing you of the short 14.8 miles left until Mount Whitney. There are a few campsites if you continue straight towards Upper Kern Basin.

6. This segment goes a western-approach climb of Mount Whitney: Guitar Lake. This is a stretch that climbs about 3500 feet in ten miles. Upon meeting Wallace Creek (which is far below you), the trail turns to the east until you eventually meet it at the junction with the JMT. About 3.5 miles in the High Sierra Trail meets the John Muir Trail where it crosses Wallace Creek. At the junction there are many campsites. Finally, you'll reach Crabtree Meadow where there is a backcountry ranger station, places to camp, and water access. From here, the trail climbs another ~800 feet in 2.5 miles to Guitar Lake at 11,400 feet.  

7. The summit of Whitney is about a 3000 foot climb from Guitar Lake. The first 2.5 miles and 2000 feet switchback up the western side of the ridge until reaching Trail Junction. Here, drop your pack (keep your food protected from marmots!), grab your camera and water, and head to the summit. The summit is another 1000 feet up in about two miles. After summiting, it's about 11 miles and 6000 feet of descent to the trailhead. Back at the Junction, pick up your pack and climb the final small stretch to Trail Crest, then descend the famous 97 switchbacks.","['Backpacking', 'Camping', 'Fishing', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'Hot springs', 'River', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'Scramble', 'Snow', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",368,107,263,california,CA,3,285,1,17,72.0,1500.0

The trail from this point, all the way to Blue Lake consists of short sections of straight trail sandwiched between repetitive series of switchbacks. Much of these switchbacks are forested but those that are not provide an excellent vista looking back toward Lake Sabrina.
 
While this is a good uphill hump, the view is what will take your breath away. The scenery is spectacular.  The trail winds up into the forest and flattens out as the trail approaches the lake.
 
Blue Lake is located at about 10,400 ft. and is very scenic.  There are excellent picnic areas at the outlet of the lake and along the back of the lake toward the inlet. Don’t stop where you first see the lake. The best spots are further up the tail.

Picturesque Lassen peaks are reflected by the tranquil waters of Manzanita Lake on this short 2 mile loop trail.

On a clear day the short and easy 2 mile loop hike around sparkling Manzanita Lake is the perfect introduction to Lassen Volcanic National Park, showcasing as it does some the best features of the park - including the glacier strewn Lassen Peak and the young Chaos Crags massif. In fact it was an enormous rockfall collapse of Chaos Crags which cut off a local creek and created this lake - be sure to check out our Chaos Crags guide for a tour of the rockfall known as Chaos Jumbles.

This spot is favored not only by hikers and photographers but also fishing enthusiasts in search of rainbow, brown and brook trout. Thankfully the lake is limited to non-motorized boats, keeping the lakeside relatively quiet.  Kayaks can be rented near the boat launch area - check the nearby campground store for details.

Situated by the northern entrance of the park, the lake is conveniently located by the historic visitor center and the large Manzanita Creek campground. Noise from the park road does infiltrate the peace of the lake somewhat, but its the price you pay for the convenience.","['Kid friendly', 'Camping', 'Fishing', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Snowshoeing', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",463,218,647,california,CA,1,243,1,17,1.9,48.0

According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=169):

Accessibility: Two parking areas have firm, designated, handicapped-accessible parking spaces with a slope no greater than 2% - one is immediately south of the Tom Lantos tunnel, the other just north of it. Both have upper and lower lots, each with one accessible space. The route from the lower lots to the trailhead is uphill. These lots fill quickly...there is also a free shuttle from Pacifica that runs Sat.-Sun. from 9 AM - 4 PM.

The paved trail consists of two 6-foot-wide bike lanes that travel in either direction and a 10-foot-wide lane alongside for walkers and horseback riders. The steepest section has a 9% grade. It would be a challenging hike in a manual wheelchair even if you have good upper body strength, so you may want to hike this trail with someone who can help on the steep uphill. To avoid the steep stretch, you could start at the northern end and have someone pick you up at the southern lot. 

Starting from the northern trailhead, a gentle but long uphill takes you past scrub-covered hillsides. A viewing area at the crest of the hill provides a welcome reprieve and is a good place to look for wildlife. After a level stretch, the trail again climbs gradually. Coasting downhill after the crest, look inland at the exposed weathered granite of Montara Mountain. A low barricade on the ocean side allows unobstructed views. To the north, you can see past the Pedro Point Headlands to Mount Tamalpais and Point Reyes in Marin County. On a rocky ledge to the south, you can see the remains of an old military bunker and tracking station that was part of a coastal defense network that stretched from Point Reyes to Half Moon Bay during the Cold War. 

In less than a quarter-mile, the trail ends at the southern trailhead and parking lot. There are accessible restrooms at both trailheads.","['Dogs on leash', 'Wheelchair friendly', 'Kid friendly', 'Stroller friendly', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Beach', 'Paved', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Historic site']",488,381,833,california,CA,1,322,1,14,3.1,93.0

The trail offers a number of activity options and is accessible year-round. Dogs are also able to use this trail but must be kept on leash.","According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=91): Half Moon Bay, the oldest town in San Mateo County, lies along a gently curving, sandy shore that is protected as parkland. Stretching for nearly four miles north to south is Half Moon Bay State Beach, a wide expanse of beach and bluff that includes four beaches: Venice, Roosevelt, Dunes, and Francis, the most wheelchair accessible and most developed. Amenities at Francis Beach include blufftop camping, blufftop picnic tables overlooking the beach, and a small visitor center with displays about local wildflowers, birds, and animals, as well as local history. Beach access for a beach wheelchair is at Roosevelt and Francis Beaches (at the northwest corner of each).

The paved Coastside Trail runs for nearly 3.5 miles behind the beaches, from Mirada Road, one mile south of Pillar Point Harbor, to Poplar Street, 0.5 miles south of Francis Beach. Numerous benches along the trail offer unobstructed ocean views.

This heavily used multi-use trail runs along the eastern boundary of Half Moon Bay State Beach and provides good pedestrian access to all four beaches in the system, as well as the city-owned Poplar Beach, south of Francis Beach. The ocean is not always visible, but when it is you can see the crescent shape of the coastline that gives Half Moon Bay its name. For a lovely outing, you can combine this walk with a meal at one of several trailside cafes at the trail's north end by Magellan Road.

A horse trail parallels the Coastside Trail between Roosevelt and Francis Beaches. The park is open from 8 AM to sunset daily and there is a parking fee.

Accessibility: The route is accessible from any of the Half Moon Bay State Beaches and from Poplar Beach and there is plentiful firm handicapped-accessible parking in any of the beach lots. There are wheelchair accessible bathrooms at Venice, Roosevelt, Dunes, and Francis Beaches and a porta-potty is in the Poplar Beach parking lot. A beach wheelchair is available for loan at the Francis Beach entry kiosk on a first-come, first-served basis. Chairs can be taken to the other beaches using your own vehicle. There are firm and stable accessible picnic tables with at least 27 inches of knee clearance at Francis and Roosevelt Beaches and along the Coastside Trail just north of Venice Beach.

The trail is paved, typically at least four feet wide, and mostly gentle (estimated 5% grade or less). From Poplar Beach, head south from the parking lot one-quarter mile to a bridge that crosses an outlet to the ocean. On the other side of the bridge, after passing through a small stand of cypress trees, the trail becomes hard-packed dirt and is very rutted. A sign indicates that this blufftop is Wavecrest, a 206-acre park set aside in part to serve as raptor wintering grounds. Although the terrain is very rough and not wheelchair accessible past 20 feet, the views are spectacular—plus, you might spot migrating whales (Nov.-Jan.) and raptors. Retrace your steps and continue north past Poplar Road - check out the view from the bluff at the foot of Poplar.

You will reach Francis Beach in about 0.8 miles, then cross the park entry road to continue along the trail, unless you want to stop in at the small visitor center (weekends only) or picnic on the bluffs. A sign indicates it is another 2.4 miles to the trail's end. The trail parallels the campground access road a short distance, then, once past the developed area, becomes quieter.

Next, you will cross Pilarcitos Creek on a long wooden bridge that's pretty bumpy. Housing is now closer to the trail and scrub obscures the ocean. Soon you will arrive at Venice Beach, where there is no wheelchair access to the beach. Continuing north a few hundred yards there is another extremely bumpy bridge. After crossing this, the trail briefly curves west and a picnic area comes into view, as does the ocean.

About 1.6 miles from Francis Beach you will arrive at Dunes Beach, then Roosevelt Beach. Beyond Roosevelt Beach, the surroundings are more residential. At Mirada Road, it may appear as if the trail ends, but continuing on traffic is sparse and moves slowly because of all the people. In a quarter of a mile, you will reach Magellan Avenue and can follow it a few hundred feet to another trailhead. This new trail travels on the bluffs through Mirada Surf, a 49-acre park that occupies one of the few remaining undeveloped coastal bluffs in the region. Signage indicates that it travels one-third of a mile north to Pillar Point Harbor.

This loop to the peak is a good way to get there: steep enough to provide a good workout and scenic enough to reward your efforts. 

Coyote Peak looks out over the southern expanse of Silicon Valley, with great views of both the Diablo Range to the east and the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west. Admittedly, this park is not the sexiest hiking locale in the South Bay, but it's extremely accessible if you're in the neighborhood. And let's face it: few city parks have hills with this much elevation gain.  

Bear in mind that the park is very popular with mountain bikers, so come prepared to share the trails. 

This hike starts out at the Pueblo Day Use Area; you have to pay to park here, but the amenities (bathrooms, water, picnic tables, lots of parking spaces) are usually unavailable at the free trailheads around the park.  

Best time to come: If you come early in the morning before it gets too hot, you can hike here all year. Springtime wildflower season is very scenic, and winter offers the best views from Coyote Peak after a strong rain cleans up the smog. Summer and fall will be hot and dry with significant wildfire risk.","['Dogs on leash', 'Kid friendly', 'Hiking', 'Horseback riding', 'Mountain biking', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife']",1305,463,710,california,CA,2,313,1,12,3.8,120.0

This hike is probably Yosemite’s ultimate dayhike. Much of this route is actually along the same trails as the more well-known Half Dome Hike. Many of the attractions along the way are the same (ie Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Mist Trail, Little Yosemite Valley, etc). But, things are different once you pass the cutoff to Half Dome. Much like Half Dome, the views from the summit are certainly worth the climb (and then some). It’s hard to say what is the better view out of this one vs Half Dome. But one definite advantage of Clouds Rest is the fact that it has a smaller summit. This allows you to see a better, 360 degree view from one place. You also get a direct view down into Yosemite’s ‘forbidden zone’, Tenaya Canyon.

Unlike Half Dome, there is no permit or lottery for this hike. Just go to the trailhead and start hiking! This makes Clouds Rest an excellent choice for those who didn’t score a Half Dome permit - particularly if less crowded weekdays are not an option for you. Speaking of the lack of permits (and the ability to do this hike on a moment’s notice if desired), the distance (10 miles one way) and elevation gain (6000ft) are on a par with Mount Whitney. This, along with relative proximity to Northern California metropolitan areas, makes the hike from Happy Isles to Clouds Rest a GREAT (and very scenic) training hike for higher peaks like Whitney and Shasta.","['Backpacking', 'Camping', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Forest', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'Muddy', 'Rocky', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",6528,86,682,california,CA,3,285,1,15,20.5,691.0

Once a booming coal mining area, the hills are now quiet and peaceful. Yet, they still offer a glimpse into the past mining history. Five coal mining towns once occupied the Black Diamond area from the 1860s until the early 1900s, the most famous being Nortonville and Somersville. Almost four million tons of coal were removed before coal mining stopped and sand mining began by the Hazel-Atlas glass company. Part of these underground mines are still accessible via guided interpretive tours.

This route takes you through the heart of the Black Diamond Mines historic area, and offers panoramic views of the surrounding hills and delta. As you initially ascend the ridge, you will pass the Rose Hill Cemetery, which is a grim but fascinating reminder of the town of Nortonville and the challenging lives its citizens lived. Past the graveyard, you will come to a lookout point that offers the first of many panoramic views. Later, descending the Black Diamond Trail, colorful sandstone rock walls tower above the scattered oak woodland. As you make your way down Black Diamond Way keep your eyes open for the giant Coulter Pines, and see if you can find “Jim’s Place”, where the “door” is always open! A little further up Black Diamond Trail is a small side trip to the Air Shaft. Make a right on Cumberland Trail, go about 100 yards and it’s on your left. Turn around and return to Black Diamond Trail to continue uphill on main route. Enjoy other beautiful views and rock formations on the rest of the hike.

Once past the cemetery,
continue uphill and over the ridge, and drop down into Nortonville. Stay left on the trail straight into Coal Canyon and head up the single track trail, straight ahead at the base of the canyon. At the top past Jim’s Place make a left on the paved Black Diamond Trail. Continue uphill until you reach a closed Park Gate. Take the left just before the Gate on a dirt road which is Black Diamond Trail.

An easy day hike or overnighter to a popular and beautiful subalpine lake.

The hike to May Lake is a bit of the essence of Yosemite -- expansive views over granite peaks, a sparkling blue lake set below 10,000' Mount Hoffmann, a subalpine forest, and, well, other people. This is not where you go for a solitary backcountry escape - but it is a delightful and beautiful place to take someone for their first backpacking trip or just an enjoyable day hike.

This route, the shortest way to May Lake, starts at the Snow Flat trailhead which is reached via a rough, narrow, but paved road off the Tioga Road. There is a vault toilet and bear boxes here, but limited parking.  The trail moves upwards, slowly at first, but with a steadily greater incline until you hit a few switchbacks. Stop on the way and make sure to check out the views - they're great!

At the top of the hill - just off the trail is a ridge with an excellent view and a great place to stop for a snack - the trail levels out again and quickly reaches the May Lake Backpacking Camp. There are bear boxes, a water spigot, and a flush toilet (!) here, and campsites all along the southeastern shore.  The May Lake High Sierra Camp is along the northern end of the lake. There is a good use trail following the southern shore that, if you follow it long enough and high enough, will take you to the summit of 10,850' Mount Hoffmann, near the geographic center of Yosemite and with great views in all directions.","['Kid friendly', 'Camping', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",404,169,546,california,CA,2,251,1,14,2.8,88.0

This short walk brings you up to and then across the Mountain Quarries RailRoad Bridge, which was the longest concrete arch railroad bridge in the world when it was built in 1912.  Enjoy great views of the Middle Fork American River Canyon and marvel at what was a fantastic feat of construction for its time. 

The triple span bridge was built by the Mountain Quarries Company and the Pacific Portland Cement Company for the purpose of hauling limestone from the nearby quarry to Auburn, 7 miles away.  Trains ran across the bridge down to the quarry 4 times daily until the quarry was abandoned.  In 1942 the tracks were pulled out for scrap metal for WWII.

You might also hear the bridge called the ""No Hands Bridge"".  This is a throwback from the early years of the Tevis Cup Trail Ride, an equestrian race that goes from Squaw Valley in Tahoe to Auburn.  Challenged by onlookers who noted the bridge's former lack of guard-rails, one of the riders, Ina Robinson, would drop her reins and go across ""No-Hands"".

It includes fantastic views of the surrounding peaks, Caples Lake, and Lake Tahoe, and is an excellent swimming destination in the summer, plus a great snow camping destination in the winter.

The trail is the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT).  It is 4 miles from the parking lot to Meiss lake, with an elevation gain of about 300 feet as you climb over the saddle before dropping down to Meiss valley.

The trail is well sign-posted and marked.  It follows the highway for a little over 1/4 a mile before turning right into a wooded valley.  After another 1/4 mile, there is a moderate climb up to the pass, before a gentle slope down to Meiss valley. The remaining 2.5 miles is flat and easy.  Shortly after the trail drops into the valley, there is a fork.  You will leave the PCT and take the left (eastern) fork, which is an old jeep route.  After a short distance you will see Meiss lake to your left (west).  It is the warmest lake in the Lake Tahoe region and great for swimming, although it is quite shallow.

Return the way you came.

In the winter, most people ignore the PCT and simply navigate directly to the saddle.  Navigation here is very easy on a clear day as there are few trees 100 feet above the parking lot, and so the visibility is excellent.  If you ignore the PCT and take a more direct route, there will be more climbing.  Beware the avalanche point on the north of the saddle, on the western side.  It creates a terrain trap out of the trail and can be dangerous.  As always in the winter, be very careful with navigation, the weather can change fast here.","['Dogs on leash', 'Backpacking', 'Camping', 'Cross country skiing', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Snowshoeing', 'Walking', 'Running', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Snow']",669,208,339,california,CA,2,320,1,15,9.8,292.0

According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=121): California's most northerly redwood park, Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, boasts some of the world's largest trees and six miles of the pristine Smith River within its 10,000 acres. The park is named for the first non-native explorer known to have traveled overland from the Mississippi River, across the Sierra Nevada range to the Pacific Coast. It's mostly undeveloped, hence unspoiled, but there are opportunities for camping, fishing, boating, and hiking. Only a few trails, the visitor center, and some campsites are wheelchair accessible.

For a scenic drive through the park that will give you a sense of isolation from the outside world, follow Howland Hill Road from Stout Grove south for five miles on a narrow dirt road to connect to Hwy. 101 just south of Crescent City. Depending on the season and when the road was last resurfaced, the ride can be very bumpy — or, as in our mid-September visit, very dusty — but will nonetheless provide an intimate encounter with an otherworldly setting. In fact, it was the extraterrestrial setting for the Ewok scene in the third Star Wars movie, Return of the Jedi.

Staffed seasonally, the Hiouchi (a Tolowa word for clear water) visitor center is just off Hwy. 199 (access has not been verified to the small Jedediah Smith visitor center inside the campground). It offers a small gift shop and exhibits on coast redwoods, wildlife, and preservation history. Start your tour of the park with a 12-minute film about the redwoods, Trees of the Coast Redwood Forest, and a self-guided walk with wayside exhibits, located just outside the center. At the entrance is a contemporary example of a traditional Tolowa river craft made of redwood.

ACCESSIBILITY: There is firm, designated, handicapped-accessible parking at the visitor center and Stout Grove trailhead with a 2% slope or less. Two accessible spaces on Walker Road also serve the Simpson-Reed and Peterson trailhead. There are wheelchair-accessible restrooms at Stout Grove (no sink) and the Hiouchi visitor center. There are none at the Simpson-Reed Discovery and Peterson Memorial Trails. Wheelchair-accessible picnic tables with a firm and stable path and surface and at least 27 inches of knee clearance can be found at the Hiouchi visitor center adjacent to the restrooms. The visitor center is wheelchair-accessible.

From the parking lot to the trailhead, a moderately steep (greater than 5%) section of deteriorated asphalt descends for several hundred feet before leveling out at the start of the loop. The trail is first paved and then compacted dirt with a thick layer of duff. It is typically at least three feet wide. Going counterclockwise, you will come to a spur trail that crosses the river via seasonal bridges but it is not accessible because a fallen tree at its start narrows the path to less than 2 feet in width. The steepest section is at the beginning; otherwise, the trail undulates slightly throughout. In a few places, the cross-slope is greater than 2% and may be bothersome to manual chair users.","['Wheelchair friendly', 'Kid friendly', 'Stroller friendly', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Forest', 'Partially paved', 'River', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Bugs', 'No dogs']",190,307,914,california,CA,1,248,1,13,0.7,16.0

The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from May until October.","A fairly simple hike on well developed trails. The steeper portions in areas heavily traveled tend to be paved, with steps and low rock walls where needed. This loop walk provides plenty of views of both the falls and Burney Creek.

Up towards the North Eastern corner of California midway between Mt. Shasta and Mt. Lassen is a spot Theodore Roosevelt once proclaimed as ""the eighth wonder of the world."" It's Burney Falls, a truly magnificent 129 foot waterfall a short run upstream from Lake Britton. This is one of the California State Parks that's a bit more remote but that's not a problem. It's a long but simple drive out of Redding through some great scenic country, ending just outside the small lumber town of Burney.

The surrounding park is within the Cascade Range and the sparsely populated Modoc Plateau region. McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial SP contains 910 acres of forest and five miles of stream side and lake shoreline on Lake Britton. 

One of the interesting facets of the landscape is that volcanic action was the dominant force shaping this part of California. Burney Creek just doesn't appear to support the water needed to supply the falls, rather, most of the flow percolates through the porous lava rock in subterranean rivers. One of these underground aquifers feeds both Burney Creek and exits the surrounding cliffs into Burney Falls itself. While the falls ï¬‚ow continuously year round, Burney creek is sometimes dry half a mile upstream.

The Park also illustrates the volcanic origins of the region. Understory bushes are muted and sparse in this region compared to other areas. One of the primary reasons is that the soil is porous and the water quickly escapes below the shallow roots of the vegetation that would normally grow in this region. 

Several Native American groups, particularly the Ilmawi Band of the Pit River Tribe, had villages in the region around the present-day park. They were known to use the technique of digging deep pits in order to trap big game animals. The nineteenth-century explorers and local settlers referred to these people as Pit River Indians in reference to this hunting technique. The falls were considered, and still are, both a deep cultural and spiritual landmark.

This region in the late 19th Century became economically important with the introduction of logging which continues to this day. In the early 20th Century, the Pit River's damming for hydo-electric generation and particularly the Pit River #3 Dam resulted in Lake Britton. A further planned dam nearly obliterated Burney Falls. Fortunately the landowner, Frank McArthur donated the falls in 1922 along with the surrounding land to the State Park system. The park honors McArthur's pioneer parents, John and Catherine McArthur. 

The initial steep journey down to the falls base can get fairly crowded but as most park visitors aren't hikers, traffic thins to a trickle as one crosses the canyon for the rest of the trip. It's a good idea to bring at least a sweatshirt town to the fall's base, the spray cools the canyon considerably, you'll want a daypack as well to stash the clothing and carry both water, a snack, and insect repellant.

Heading up the opposite side of the canyon can be a long trudge for youngsters. Once at the top of the falls, the Burney Falls Loop Trail levels out. 

HINT: The Fisherman's Bridge provides a major shortcut back to the Visitor Center or better yet, the General Store for that soft-serve ice cream bribe you gave the kids.

Upper Burney Creek's trail isn't difficult but provides numerous short rises and falls in the trail and broken shade. There's also plenty of easy access points to the creek for fishing.","['Kid friendly', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Forest', 'Partially paved', 'River', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'No dogs']",911,76,351,california,CA,1,269,1,11,2.7,76.0

The trail is primarily used for hiking, running, and nature trips. Dogs are also able to use this trail.","Begin at the Stonewall Road Trailhead. The steep fire road is easy to follow, always rutted and rocky with some easy flats but mostly very steep. You pass four benches, each with a great view. The last section, before you hit the pavement of Panoramic Road, is the steepest, and also rocky, rutted, and loose. Shoes with decent rubber and tread required. If balance is an issue, bring trekking poles. 

To continue to Chaparral Peak, Grizzly Peak Road, or Vollmer Peak, when you get to then pavement of Panoramic Road, go up and right on the pavement, not down and left. The pavement runs out in less than a hundred yards at a secluded private driveway, and the only way to go is a hard right turn onto another fire road, which, though popular, doesn't have a name.

Following this fire road all the way will get you to Grizzly Peak Road which is a thoroughfare traversing the Berkeley hills. From the end of the pavement, the fire road follows along the ridgeline beside a row of tall Eucalyptus trees, splits briefly at the fourth and last bench beside an open area, then rejoins a short way to ascend, steep and straight, a hundred feet up in the first of three significant climbs. It's worth noting that at the base of this climb is the first of three short connecting lefthand trails that will bring the hiker to the Upper Jordon Fire Trail, which circles Strawberry Canyon, long and almost level.

After the steep and straight hike up the hill, the fire road passes another open area, with a solitary Oak tree instead of a bench, it then descends gradually, then more steeply to the base of the second steep section. It is not apparent unless you've looked at a map, but at this point, the fire road and the Upper Jordon fire trail are very adjacent, less than a hundred feet apart, and if you wish, you can easily clamber left and down through the trees to the Upper Jordon Fire Trail.

The trail is primarily used for hiking and walking and is accessible year-round.","Beautiful coastal views. Easy gravel trail, great for a relaxing walk with the family. The southern portion of this country road trail is only open on the weekends and Federal holidays. The trail and parking area are open on weekends and holidays from 8 AM to sunset. This trail is not open during weekdays.

According to Access Northern California (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=139): From the Cowell Ranch Beach parking area (northern trailhead), the trail leads west through farm fields for 0.5 miles, slightly downhill all the way, to a blufftop. Be sure to look for a metal sculpture in the shape of a whale on the fence to your left. Interpretive panels along the trail describe common plants and wildlife and offer a bit of local history.

Just before you reach the blufftop viewing area, you will pass a rickety, inaccessible porta-potty next to where the Cowell-Purisima trail heads south. Continue past the trail to the bluff, where you can look down on Cowell Ranch Beach to the north. To the south, you can see a rocky cove where harbor seals like to haul out. They tend to be here from late winter through spring - use binoculars or the lowered telescope to look for seal pups in March and April. After about one mile you come to an interpretive sign marking the site of an ancient Ohlone village.

Accessibility: There are van-accessible parking spaces with a cross-slope less than 2% in both the gravel parking lots at the north and south trailheads (with spaces designated for vans in the southern lot). If using a manual wheelchair or stroller, it is recommended by park staff to make this trail an out-and-back route (from either direction) due to a steep section in the middle where the trail crosses Purisima Creek that is not considered accessible. If you hike the accessible section at the southern end of the trail, you will see very similar views but miss the Cowell Ranch Beach viewpoint overlooking the harbor seal pullout. The trail surface is gravel and it is typically at least three feet wide. There are multiple steep sections where the grade is about 10%. The average grade is 3%.

From the north, some wheelchair riders may require assistance to negotiate a downhill cross-slope right at the entry. From here the trail winds downhill to a bridge over a creek and heads west again toward the bluffs. The trail along the bluffs is wide and level, but there are patches of deep gravel here and there that can be difficult to negotiate. You soon come to another bridge over a creek drainage and the trail narrows to a 29-inch shoulder height where it is suggested to turn around.

There are accessible vault toilets at the southern trailhead parking lot (but no sink), and a partially-accessible portable toilet at the northern lot (steep lip to enter and no turnaround room inside). Cowell Ranch Beach to the north is accessible only by a steep staircase.","['Kid friendly', 'Hiking', 'Walking', 'Beach', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'No dogs']",374,226,388,california,CA,1,262,1,8,7.0,185.0

Signage at the trailhead limits parking. The only place to park is the side of the road and, on weekends, the line of cars can get long enough to block part of the road. If you do this, you are risking a ticket. $10 to park.","['Kid friendly', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Cave', 'Forest', 'Partially paved', 'River', 'Views', 'Waterfall', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Fee', 'No dogs']",265,108,511,california,CA,1,291,1,15,2.8,75.0

A backpacking loop to two subalpine lakes just outside of Sequoia National Park.

This trip does a loop through the Jennie Lakes Wilderness, visiting two subalpine lakes suitable for fishing at the height of summer. It can be done as a long overnighter but is better as a 2.5 day trip, spending the night at each lake. The recommended route is to go to Jennie Lake first and then to Weaver to reduce the amount of climbing.

Start at the Fox Meadow trailhead, which is reachable via a tolerable-for-passenger-cars dirt road. If you would prefer pavement, the Big Meadows trailhead adds about a mile and 400 feet of climbing on either end. At a creekside junction with the Weaver Lake Trail, stay on your side of the creek and head up towards Jennie Lake rather than going towards Weaver Lake. Work through the forest around Shell Mountain, breaking out to views of the Kaweah Divide to the south. Do the gentle climb over Poop Out Pass, and then drop and climb again (more strenuously this time) to subalpine and popular Jennie Lake. Campsites are located on the north and west sides of the lake.

From Jennie Lake, head east on the trail, climbing towards the ridgeline and JO Pass. Enjoy the ridgeline views until you reach the pass, where you get a nice view of Mount Silliman and Sequoia National Park. From JO Pass, head north and down, making sure to follow the route towards Weaver Lake rather than Rowell Meadow.

Reach the badly-signed intersection with the Weaver Lake-Rowell Meadow trail and head west (left), soon turning south and dropping precipitously into Boulder Creek Canyon - enjoy the views of the Kaweah Divide where Jennie Lake is hiding from your view. There are a few crossings of forks of Boulder Creek before you climb and ascend the north side of Shell Mountain, regaining much of the altitude you lost from Jennie Lake.

Reach the Weaver Lake junction and head south 0.2 mile to the lake. While smaller than Jennie, it is just as pretty. From Weaver Lake, head back to the trail junction and continue the way you had been heading, eventually crossing a creek and reaching a junction with the Jennie Lake trail. Head back down to the Fox Meadow trailhead.

A day hike around beautiful lakes in the eastern Sierra, just outside the east entrance to Yosemite on Tioga pass. This alpine basin studded with lakes and ringed by spectacular mountains appeals to hikers seeking exceptional scenery without the stiff elevation gains required of most lakes in northern Yosemite

Twenty Lakes Loop is a beautiful hike that starts from the Saddlebag lake (10,000ft) and takes you around some of the most amazing alpine lakes. You get great views of the near by peaks: North Peak and Mt. Conness.

This is an easy hike if you are acclimatized to the altitude. You might feel short of breath if you just arrived and started hiking, since the trail head is at 10,000ft.

Hike the highs and lows of Pinnacles National Monument, one of the best parks in central California.

The striking terrain of the Pinnacles National Monument might make you feel like you're at least a couple of state borders away from the San Francisco Bay Area, but in truth this national park is less than a hundred miles south of San Jose. 

Our recommended route combines two of the most popular trails in the park - boasting caves, some tight squeezes in high places and to top it all off, the chance to spot the endangered Californian condor.

Tips:
- Summer conditions can be fierce on hikers in this park, so plan to tackle this park in cooler weather and remember to bring plenty of water. There is a water spigot at the West Chaparral parking lot which comes in useful.
- Bring a flashlight or headlamp for the short yet pitch-black section of the Balconies Cave.
- Check the park's official website for trail closures in the winter/spring nesting season.
- A day use fee is payable at the park.

Alternatives:
- Balconies cave short semi-loop hike from the Chaparral entrance, with minimal elevation gain.
- High Peaks loop trail from Bear Gulch, which boasts a shorter route to the top of the mountain, but without the Balconies Cave experience.","['Hiking', 'Bird watching', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'No shade', 'No dogs']",2548,115,670,california,CA,2,266,1,8,7.9,264.0

Multiple viewpoints of Castle Peak and Mule's Ear are other highlights of this moderate climb to the viewpoint.

The hike begins in a forest of white firs and lodgepole and western white pines.  Stay right at the two junctions with the Glacier Meadow Loop. At about 0.4 miles a shallow pond is passed before reaching a junction of the PCT near a meadow.  Turn left (north) and follow the PCT along the western end of the meadow toward I-80.  At about 0.7 miles the trail passes under I-80 in a couple of culverts.  Continue by climbing slightly to a four-way junction at about 0.9 miles. Turn right (for Summit and Warren Lakes) and follow the trail as it climbs at a moderate slope through patches of mixed forest and open areas of granite to the northeast.  At about 1.6 miles the Summit Lake Trail junction is reached just after passing a small meadow. 

Staying left at the junction, the Warren Lake/Frog Lake Overlook trail climbs steeply up through the mixed forest to a volcanic ridge immediately west of Peak 7888. Take a short side-trip to this peak for some great views of the surroundings. The trail continues to climb steeply from here and passes in and out of a few treed and meadow stretches before leveling out temporarily to cross a tributary of South Fork Prosser Creek. At the crossing, monkeyflowers and alpine lilies can be found. The steep climb continues after the creek crossing as the trail makes its way up to a saddle immediately west of Peak 8653. Below the saddle is a beautiful open area with loads of arrowleaf balsamroot and Mule's Ear as well as views to the south and Castle Peak to the west. At the saddle is a four-way junction (about 3.0 miles). Use-trails lead to the left and right. The left trail leads along the ridge towards Castle Peak and the right leads to the top of Peak 8653 and the edge of Frog Lake Cliff. The right trail leads to the fantastic overlook in about 0.1 miles.  Sit down and enjoy the view over privately-owned Frog Lake and in just about any other direction for that matter. Castle Peak is directly west and Northstar is visible to the southeast.

Once you are ready to leave the views get back on the main trail and retrace your steps down to the Summit Lake Trail junction. For those looking for more miles, continue northwest on the main trail for about 3.5 miles from the four-way junction and reach Warren Lake. Back at the Summit Lake Trail junction, follow Summit Lake Trail east through some open sections before descending back into the forest to the southern shore of Summit Lake (about 0.55 miles from the trail intersection). Summit Lake isn't terribly scenic, but it is pretty. Once you are ready, retrace your steps to the trail junction and then the trailhead.","['Dog friendly', 'Hiking', 'Nature trips', 'Bird watching', 'Forest', 'Lake', 'Views', 'Wild flowers', 'Wildlife', 'Rocky', 'Snow']",745,199,306,california,CA,2,312,1,11,6.8,228.0

According to Access Northern CA (http://accessnca.org/access-northern-california/explore/explore-detail-view/?site_id=172): Alviso Marina County Park is the gateway to the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge. You can picnic and launch your small boat in this 20-acre park along Alviso Slough, at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, but the big draw is the many miles of levee trails that wrap around adjacent salt ponds. It’s an ideal place for spotting migratory birds and numerous resident birds, including northern harrier hawks, killdeer, song sparrows, and great egrets. You can easily spend all day here if you explore trails in the adjacent Don Edwards San Francisco Bay Wildlife Refuge.

The Environmental Education Center has displays on the South Bay’s ecology and history, a small bookstore, and replicas of the reed boats and shelters used by the native people. It is used for school programs and other events on weekdays and is open to the public on weekends. The entry door is rather heavy.

The town of Alviso was once envisioned as the bustling boating and shipping port of San Jose, but that prospect was diminished by a series of events, including the completion of the railroad, the relocation of the state capital from San Jose to Sacramento, and winter flooding and muddy conditions. Sparsely populated today, the town is listed in the Santa Clara County National Register of Historic Places.

Accessibility: There is designated, van-accessible parking at the park entry, although the boat launch lot has no designated parking. The trail surface is partially boardwalk and partially dirt and it is typically at least four feet wide. It is flat with an average grade of 1% and a max grade of 2%. There is a gentle slope by the trailheads. There is an accessible bathroom by the parking lot but not on the trail. There is an accessible picnic area near the parking lot with a firm and stable surface to the tables, firm and stable surfaces, and at least 27 inches of knee clearance.","['Wheelchair friendly', 'Kid friendly', 'Stroller friendly', 'Hiking', 'Mountain biking', 'Nature trips', 'Walking', 'Bird watching', 'Running', 'Beach', 'Lake', 'Partially paved', 'Views', 'No shade', 'Historic site', 'No dogs']",582,378,592,california,CA,1,224,1,16,9.0,220.0
